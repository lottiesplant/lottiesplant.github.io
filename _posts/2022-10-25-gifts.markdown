Sometimes I like to imagine the people I love by the gifts they have given me:

There is my grandma, who gave me the gift of Music. She taught me a beautiful skill, and now I have something to always be proud of. I can soothe. I can entertain. I can practice. I can rely on it.

There is my fiance, who gave me the gift of Noticing. He showed me how to notice the tiny details in life, like a strange bug on a leaf, or a mis-woven belt in a clothing store. I see more and I am delighted by more. The world itself can keep me grounded in its details.

There is my high school best/girlfriend, who gave me the gift of Creating. She showed me how to make things with my hands, yarn, and fabric. She showed me how to channel inspiration into creation, to appreciate things by contributing my own art… I have so many scarves now.

There is my current (and wonderful) best friend, who is giving me the gift of Nuance. She stands by her values while navigating different opinions and perspectives. She can connect with anyone. She can correct anyone with understanding and kindness. Much as I want to keep my hardlined stances, she gives me something to aspire to.

There’s so much more to say, but I’ll leave it there for now. Just a tidbit of a recurring thought.
