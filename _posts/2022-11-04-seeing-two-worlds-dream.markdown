I had an interesting dream. Here's my attempt to write it out:
<p></p>
--------
<p></p>
I'm stumbling over a grassy hill. My vision swims in violet green waves, making it hard to see, but I know where I'm going.

Now I'm walking through a door into a dimly lit room made of beautiful dark logs (I'm in third person now-- I can see my pale apprehensive face contrasted against the cabin walls). A long table takes up most of the room, lined with important people and headed by a bulky, irritated-looking man. Your classic board meeting, but rustic and weary. I'm clearly not supposed to be here, but I need to tell them something urgent. I'm not sure what.

I'm back in my own eyes again. My vision flashes between scenes before me: The board room, then a hospital, then the board room again, then a bright grassy field, then back to the board room with different people. Or maybe the same people with disguises removed. I look up and see my visions projected on the cabin wall for everyone to see.

"She sees the truth," someone says. I am relieved they agree.

I quickly realize this is a bad thing, though. Now I am running away, back across the grassy hill. Eventually I run down toward a beach onto a dock and off the end of it without breaking stride. Salt gets in my mouth as I hit the warm ocean water.

I blink underwater in a bright teal landscape that feels familiar. I feel safe, then curious when I notice cloudy grey blobs hovering twenty meters ahead. My vision flashes again: blobs, then merpeople, then blobs, merpeople, blobs, merpeople drawing arrows-- I am shot at. Bubbles escape my lips in confusion as the arrows streak past me, leaving trails of hydric turbulence. The truth is dangerous.

I wake up.

Gotta say, much more pleasant than my teeth-falling-out dreams. I've been playing with adapting this into a longer story: The character lives in a village disguised by some power from the rest of the world. Unlike anyone else, she can see both the village and the illusion. Insert plot.

Most of my dreams are this vivid, but not usually so cohesive. Honestly, I kinda cherish it.
