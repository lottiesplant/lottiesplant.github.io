Hello!

I’m Lottie. I started this website because I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about my experiences living with bipolar disorder. I struggle to talk about it with people in my life either because I don’t trust them or they haven’t asked. Naturally, it feels safer to announce it to the whole dang world instead. Let’s really get in the weeds.

I’m going to write however I want as I explore my voice. I’m actually not much of a writer beyond my journal and some technical reports. Yet my mind is screaming to get some things out, so let’s just hope I get better over time. Some posts will be long, some short, and topics might vary wildly in the end. My goal is just to write!

You’ll see me try nature writing as well. My favorite book is *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek* by Annie Dillard. Whenever I read it, I want to write like she does. She makes the world worth noticing.

My experiences are heavily influenced by identities I was born with: white, cis, female, American, pansexual (though that took a minute to understand, and I’m criminally straight-presenting these days). Being a medium-sized white woman, my experience with manic episodes was/is a lot different than I imagine it would be as, say, a large black man. I’m generally not considered threatening, which ironically puts *me* in less danger (...sort of).

I was born in the Pacific Northwest and it keeps dragging me back. It’s too beautiful here. I’m in my late 20s now, and I finally call it home.

...

One last note, there are some other “lottiewrites”-esque usernames and people out there that I googled only after buying this domain. They aren’t me. This is my only thing. Sorry I stole it guys.
